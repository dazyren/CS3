			<ul>
			<li>Sova is my third favorite character from Valorant. He is a hunter and an archer which survived in the cold Russian forest. He's a man of will and commitment.</li>
			<li>His role is a iniatiator which he can get information for the team. or help entry on to important areas.</li>
			<li>I sometimes only use Sova when theres enough duelists or sentinels. He's actually a good agent if you know how to play him.</li>
