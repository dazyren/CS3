			<li>Chamber is my second favorite character from Valorant. He's a weapon designer from french.</li>
			<li>His role is a sentinel which he defends, checks, and reject areas for enemy agents.</li>
			<li>Chamber was my favorite agent to play, but now he's getting weaker due to nerfs to his abilities. Though, he's still strong to use.</li>
