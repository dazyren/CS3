	    <h1>Jojo's Bizzare Adventure</h1>
		<p>This is actually the first Anime I watched. At first I really didn't think of watching it but my friends made me. The plot and the characters are actually really well thought. And especially how the authors and writers are good at thinking of powers of the characters. Its really a 9.5/10 for me </p>
