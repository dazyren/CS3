  <p>I took a photo from our place after travelling with my friends.
     <br>How I took the photo turned out great. I really adored the beauty of the atmosphere in our place during sunsets. 
     <br>It makes me feel happy, and yet, sad since the sun will not be there for long. And that is the reason why I like sunsets.<p>
