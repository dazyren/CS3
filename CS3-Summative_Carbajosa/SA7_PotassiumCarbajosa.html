			of 10 and the code loops again and the final fortune will be 1. Using the division and modulo operators, is one way to add 
			the digits of the fortune if it exceed 9. For example, 37 the lenght exceeds 9, and going through our code: it then first
			gets the remainder of the 3, which is 7. In which we happen to have the ones. This is then stored in the actualfortune to
			be added with the upcoming values. After it is added, it then is divided by 10 and floored down to get the value of the second digit.
			(Dividing 37 by 10 will result to 3.7 and flooring it result to 3) After that is finished, it will then go through another iteration
			which adds it to the remainder of the second digit.  Since 3%10=3, it will add it with the actualfortune with the value of 7 resulting
			to actualfortune having an updated value of 10. Then 3 is divided to 10, which results to 0.3 but is floored down, resulting to 0. This ends the loop.
			But since fortune is still greater than 9, it will run through the loop. The fortune having a value of 10 will now be modulated through 10 which results to
			0 being assigned to actualfortune. It will then run through a division which 10/10 will result to 1 and if it is run again, the remainder of 1 divided by 10
			is 1 and therefore the actualfortune will have the value of one. Then 1 is then divided by 10, which is 0.1 but is floored down, will result to 0.
			This end the loop and updates the value of the fortune (actualfortune = 1, whereas: fortune=1). And the statement does not satisfy the loop anymore, thus
			the loop breaks. It will then run through the cases.
